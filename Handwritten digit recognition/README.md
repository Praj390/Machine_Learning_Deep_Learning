## Objective
Develop a Python application to load the MNIST dataset and implement a CNN-based handwritten digit classification algorithm. 

## Requirements
1. Python 3 (3.7.4)
2. torch (1.7.1)
3. Pandas (0.25.1)

## Dataset Preparation
1. Download the dataset from "http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" and unzip into your code directory under MNIST folder (Create MNIST folder).
2. To store the model, create 'results' folder in the same directory. 
3. To preprocess the data, run convert.py by using following command
``` python convert.py```.
4. To train the model run train.py file by using following command
```python train.py```.
5. To test the model function is given in the train.py which takes one image array and predict it.
